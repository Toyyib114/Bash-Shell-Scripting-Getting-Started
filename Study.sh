 #flag -s checks if file is empty or not ,-w .-x . -r check if file is writable,executable or readable , if not use chmod +r /+x/+w file_name to correct accordingly,(chmod -r /-x/-w file_name) removes permsns too.  cmd "cat > file_name" can be used to append text to the file from cmd propmt ,ctrl+d to exit cat , "cat file_name" shows file content
